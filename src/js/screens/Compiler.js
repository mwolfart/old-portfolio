                        This is a project made for the course INF01147 (Compiladores) along with Lu√≠s Miguel Batista dos Santos. It is a compiler build in C in order to interpret a fictional language made by the professor. The project is separated in seven cumulative parts: lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer, AST generator, semantic analyzer, three-address code generator, and optimizations.
                        The project repository is located <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mwolfart/compiladores-trabalho/src/new-master/">here</a>. In order to build the compiler you can run the Makefile for the desired part of the project.
