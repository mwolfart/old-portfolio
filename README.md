# Portofolio

This is a portfolio application designed & created in 2020 using Create React App (CRA).
The goal of the project was, besides developing a portfolio of my own, also learning ReactJS basic concepts and improving front-end skills.

## Tools

- ReactJS as a framework, using classes
- BEM naming convetion for CSS classes
- Jest and testing library for testing
- Font Awesome for icons

## Running the application

The application can be run using default CRA scripts: `npm install`, `npm run build` & `npm run start`.

## Misc

This was one of my first ReactJS applications and is not mantained anymore. Some bugs may be present, as well as outdated patterns and concepts (the project was started when hooks were still a new thing).
